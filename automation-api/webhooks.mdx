In contrast to API keys (which can be created by anyone in the organization and are scoped to users), you must be an organization admin to set up and manage webhooks since they fire on every order and order batch in the organization.

## Set up webhooks

To set up webhooks, go to **Organization** on the top right, then **Automation API** in the sub-menu, or click the link for your environment:

| Environment    | Webhooks Link                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Production** | https://www.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/automation     |
| **Sandbox**    | https://sandbox.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/automation |

## Setting up a new webhook

![](/images/new-webhooks.png)

Enter a URL to recieve webhooks in the **Endpoint URL** section.

You can leave **Message Filtering** blank to receive all events, or select specific events to receive.

## Webhook security

To ensure the integrity of the webhooks you receive, we recommend verifying the signatures of the webhooks you receive. Svix provides packages for multiple languages that make verifying signatures easy.

To see how, go to the Webhook Security page.

## Logs

You can view the logs for webhook delivery for each endpoint, and re-send any failed webhooks if needed.
